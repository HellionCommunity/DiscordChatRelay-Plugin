# DiscordChatRelay-Plugin
Relays In-game Chat from a Hellion Server running HES to a Discord server and Sends discord chat back. 

Plugin For https://github.com/HellionCommunity/HellionExtendedServer

    Version: 1.0.0 - Dev
    Name: HesDiscordChatBot

Config.json

    DiscordToken - Your discord bot token goes here
    MainChannelID - The channel id (right click channel, copy id in discord(if you have discord developer mode enabled)) you want to 
    send chat to, and from (its a single channel in the initial release)

If the token and channelID are correct, and your bot has been authorized in your server with permissions granted, your chat from the 
specified channel will be relayed inside the game chat box.  And any global in-game chat will be relayed to the specified channel in discord.

This is the first alpha version, it does work.  
But there isn't any customization except the discord channel to get and recieve chat from! 

Features that will be added:

    Customize the the To/From Text
    Customize the text color.
    Using the same commands in discord and in-game if desired
    Able to create custom text based commands.
   
The listed features are only some of the planned features for this plugin.  There is no timetable on when these features will be added.
We still have work to do on HES before we polish our plugins ;)
